        <h1>What is Kigo?</h1>
        <p>
          Best case scenario it is a place for reading and sharing haiku. But, being no stranger to fringe weblogs, my guess is it'll quickly devolve into a place for troglodytic internet-users to express themselves psychosexually. Either way--enjoy!

          A <i>kigo</i> (季語 "season word") is a word or phrase meant to evoke the season in which a poem is 
          set. E.g., cherry blossoms are a common spring kigo in japanese poetry, whereas 
          the moon is strongly associated with autumn. I partly chose the name because it has the substr "go" in it, which is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language)" style="text-decoration: none; color: blue;" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the language</a> in which this website was written. But also I thought it sounded cool. And isn't that reason enough?

        <h1>What are Haiku?</h1>
        <p>
          A haiku is a form of short unrhymed Japanese poem typically constrained to three lines containing 5, 7, and 5 syllables, respectively. A haiku, by nature, is a distillation of an experience: it is a mood and a moment in time. It reflects a fresh way of seeing that is unselfconscious/childlike. It deals strictly in the immediate: any authorial interpretation ought to be omitted. Most importantly, its language should be resonant, natural, and succinct.
