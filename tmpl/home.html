        A <strong style="font-weight: bold">haiku</strong> is a form of short unrhymed Japanese poem typically constrained to three lines containing 5, 7, and 5 syllables, respectively. A haiku, by nature, is a distillation of an experience: it is a mood and a moment in time. It reflects a fresh way of seeing that is unselfconscious/childlike. It deals strictly in the immediate: any authorial interpretation ought to be omitted. Most importantly, its language should be resonant, natural, and succinct.<br><br><i>"The poet pares away that which is nonessential; what is left is haiku."</i> --anon
